Description: 
                MiniNExT (MiniNet ExTended) is a layer of extensions
                on top of the existing Mininet software package. We are working
                to upstream some of these extensions into mainline Mininet.
                MiniNExT is part of the PEERING project at USC, which combines
                multiple technologies (MiniNExT, BGPMux, Transit Portal, TP at Scale)
                to lower the barriers to Internet routing research.
